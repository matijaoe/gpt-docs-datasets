CSS Grids, flexboxes, or even Masonry, you get the full controls.\n\nSince we have UnoCSS built-in, here is one simple way for you to reference:\n\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n<div>\n\nThe first column\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe second column\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\nGo further, you can customize the size of each column like:\n\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-[200px_1fr_10%] gap-4\">\n<div>\n\nThe first column (200px)\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe second column (auto fit)\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe third column (10% width to parent container)\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\nLearn more about Windi CSS Grids.\n\nPositioning\n#\n\nSlides are defined in fixed sizes (default 980x552px) and scale to fit with the user screen. You can safely use absolute position in your slides as they will scale along with the screen.\n\nFor example:\n\n<div class=\"absolute left-30px bottom-30px\">\nThis is a left-bottom aligned footer\n</div>\n\n\nTo change the canvas' actual size, you can pass the canvasWidth options in your first frontmatter:\n\n---\ncanvasWidth: 800\n---\n\nFont Size\n#\n\nIf you feel the font size in your slides are too small, you can adjust it in a few ways:\n\nOverride Local Style\n#\n\nYou can override styles for each slide with the inlined <style> tag.\n\n# Page 1\n\n<style>\nh1 {\n  font-size: 10em;\n}\n</style>\n\n---\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis will not be affected.\n\n\nLearn more: Embedded Styles\n\nOverride Global Style\n#\n\nYou can provide custom global styles by creating ./style.css, for example\n\n/* style.css */ \n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 10em !important;\n}\n\n\nLearn more: Global Style\n\nScale the Canvas\n#\n\nChanging the canvas' actual size will scale all your contents(text, images, components, etc.) and slides\n\n---\n# default: 980\n# since the canvas gets smaller, the visual size will become larger\ncanvasWidth: 800\n---\n\nUse Transform\n#\n\nWe provide a built-in component <Transform />, which is a thin wrapper of CSS transform property.\n\n<Transform :scale=\"1.4\">\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n</Transform>\n"

    "html": "Why Slidev\n#\n\nThere are a lot of feature-rich, general-purpose, WYSIWYG slides makers like Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote. They work pretty well for making nice slides with animations, charts, and many other things, while being very intuitive and easy to learn. So why bother making Slidev?\n\nSlidev aims to provide the flexibility and interactivity for developers to make their presentations even more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using the tools and technologies they are already familiar with.\n\nWhen working with WYSIWYG editors, it is easy to get distracted by the styling options. Slidev remedies that by separating the content and visuals. This allows you to focus on one thing at a time, while also being able to reuse the themes from the community. Slidev does not seek to replace other slide deck builders entirely. Rather, it focuses on catering to the developer community.\n\nSlidev\n#\n\nHere are a few of the coolest features of Slidev:\n\nMarkdown-based\n#\n\nSlidev uses an extended Markdown format to store and organize your slides in a single plain text file. This lets you focus on making the content. And since the content and styles are separated, this also made it possible to switch between different themes effortlessly.\n\nLearn more about Slidev's Markdown Syntax.\n\nThemable\n#\n\nThemes for Slidev can be shared and installed using npm packages. You then apply them with only one line of config.\n\nCheck out the theme gallery or learn how to write a theme.\n\nDeveloper Friendly\n#\n\nSlidev provides first-class support for code snippets for developers. It supports both Prism and Shiki to get pixel perfect syntax highlighting, while still being able to modify the code at any time. With Monaco editor built-in, it also empowers you to do live coding / demonstration in your presentation with autocompletion, type hovering, and even TypeScript type check support.\n\nLearn more about highlighters and Monaco configuration.\n\nFast\n#\n\nSlidev is powered by Vite, Vue 3 and UnoCSS, which give you the most wonderful authoring experience. Every change you made will reflect to your slides instantly.\n\nFind more about our tech stack.\n\nInteractive & Expressive\n#\n\nYou can write custom Vue components and use them directly inside your markdown file. You can also interact with them inside the presentation to express your idea in a more interesting and intuitive way.\n\nRecording Support\n#\n\nSlidev provides built-in recording and camera view. You can share your presentation with your camera view inside, or record and save them separately for your screen and camera. All with one go, no additional tools are needed.\n\nLearn more about recording here.\n\nPortable\n#\n\nExport your slides into PDF, PNGs, or even a hostable Single-page Application (SPA) with a single command, and share them anywhere.\n\nRead more about that in the exporting docs.\n\nHackable\n#\n\nBeing powered by web technologies, anything that can be done in a web app is also possible with Slidev. For example, WebGL, API requests, iframes, or even live sharing. It's up to your imagination!\n\nGive it a Try\n#\n\nPlaying around with Slidev will tell you more than a thousand words. You are just one command away:\n\n$ npm init slidev\n\n\nOr have a quick preview of it:"

It's a shorthand to apply the v-click directive to all its child elements. It is especially useful when working with lists.\n\n<v-clicks>\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n- Item 4\n\n</v-clicks>\n\n\nAn item will become visible each time you click \"next\".\n\nIt accepts a depth props for nested list:\n\n<v-clicks depth=\"2\">\n\n- Item 1\n  - Item 1.1\n  - Item 1.2\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2.1\n  - Item 2.2\n\n</v-clicks>\n\nCustom Clicks Count\n#\n\nBy default, Slidev counts how many steps are needed before going to the next slide. You can override this setting by passing the clicks frontmatter option:\n\n---\n# 10 clicks in this slide, before going to the next\nclicks: 10\n---\n\nOrdering\n#\n\nPassing the click index to your directives, you can customize the order of the revealing\n\n<div v-click>1</div>\n<div v-click>2</div>\n<div v-click>3</div>\n\n<!-- the order is reversed -->\n<div v-click=\"3\">1</div>\n<div v-click=\"2\">2</div>\n<div v-click=\"1\">3</div>\n\n---\nclicks: 3\n---\n\n<!-- visible after 3 clicks -->\n<v-clicks at=\"3\">\n  <div>Hi</div>\n</v-clicks>\n\nEnter & Leave\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nYou can also specify the enter and leave index for the v-click directive by passing an array. The end index is exclusive.\n\n<div v-click=\"[2, 4]\">This will be shown on the 2nd and 3rd clicks, and hide again after the 4th.</div>\n\nElement Transitions\n#\n\nWhen you apply the v-click directive to your elements, it will attach the class name slidev-vclick-target to it. When the elements are hidden, the class name slidev-vclick-hidden will also be attached. For example:\n\n<div class=\"slidev-vclick-target slidev-vclick-hidden\">Text</div>\n\n\nAfter a click, it will become\n\n<div class=\"slidev-vclick-target\">Text</div>\n\n\nBy default, a subtle opacity transition is applied to those classes:\n\n// the default\n\n.slidev-vclick-target {\n  transition: opacity 100ms ease;\n}\n\n.slidev-vclick-hidden {\n  opacity: 0;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n\nYou can override them to customize the transition effects in your custom stylesheets.\n\nFor example, you can achieve the scaling up transitions by:\n\n// styles.css\n\n.slidev-vclick-target {\n  transition: all 500ms ease;\n}\n\n.slidev-vclick-hidden {\n  transform: scale(0);\n}\n\n\nTo specify animations for only certain slide or layout\n\n.slidev-page-7,\n.slidev-layout.my-custom-layout {\n  .slidev-vclick-target {\n    transition: all 500ms ease;\n  }\n\n  .slidev-vclick-hidden {\n    transform: scale(0);\n  }\n}\n\n\nLearn more about customizing styles.\n\nMotion\n#\n\nSlidev has @vueuse/motion built-in. You can use the v-motion directive to any elements to make apply motion on them. For example\n\n<div\n  v-motion\n  :initial=\"{ x: -80 }\"\n  :enter=\"{ x: 0 }\">\n  Slidev\n</div>\n\n\nThe text Slidev will move from -80px to its original position on initialization.\n\nNote: Slidev preloads the next slide for performance, which means the animations might start before you navigate to the page. To get it works properly, you can disable the preloading for the particular slide\n\n---\npreload: false\n---\n\n\nOr control the element life-cycle with v-if to have fine-grained controls\n\n<div\n  v-if=\"$slidev.nav.currentPage === 7\"\n  v-motion\n  :initial=\"{ x: -80 }\"\n  :enter=\"{ x: 0 }\">\n  Slidev\n</div>\n\n\nLearn mode: Demo | @vueuse/motion | v-motion | Presets\n\nSlide Transitions\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.39.0\n\nSlidev supports slide transitions out of the box. You can enable it by setting the transition frontmatter option:\n\n---\ntransition: slide-left\n---\n\n\nThis will give you a nice sliding effects on slide switching. Setting it in the frontmatter will apply to all slides. You can also set different transition per slide.\n\nBuiltin Transitions\n#\nfade - Crossfade in/out\nfade-out - Fade out and then fade in\nslide-left - Slides to the left (slide to right when going backward)\nslide-right - Slides to the right (slide to left when going backward)\nslide-up - Slides to the top (slide to bottom when going backward)\nslide-down - Slides to the bottom (slide to top when going backward)\nview-transition - Slides with the view transitions API\nView Transitions\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nThe View Transitions API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different DOM states. Learn more how it works in View Transitions API - MDN Web Docs - Mozilla.\n\nExperimental: This is not supported by all browsers. Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this.\n\nYou can use the view-transition-name CSS property to name view transitions, which creates connections between different page elements and smooth transitions when switching slides.\n\nYou can enable MDC (Markdown Component) Syntax support to conveniently name view-transitions:\n\n---\ntransition: view-transition\nmdc: true\n---\n# View Transition {.inline-block.view-transition-title}\n---\n# View Transition {.inline-block.view-transition-title}\n\nCustom Transitions\n#\n\nSlidev's slide transitions are powered by Vue Transition. You can provide your custom transitions by:\n\n---\ntransition: my-transition\n---\n\n\nand then in your custom stylesheets:\n\n.my-transition-enter-active,\n.my-transition-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.my-transition-enter-from,\n.my-transition-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\n\nLearn more how it works in Vue Transition.\n\nForward & Backward Transitions\n#\n\nYou can specify different transitions for forward and backward navigation using | as a separator in the transition name:\n\n---\ntransition: go-forward | go-backward\n---\n\n\nWith this, when you go from slide 1 to slide 2, the go-forward transition will be applied. When you go from slide 2 to slide 1, the go-backward transition will be applied.\n\nAdvanced Usage\n#\n\nThe transition field accepts an option that will passed to the <TransitionGroup> component. For example:\n\n---\ntransition:\n  name: my-transition\n  enterFromClass: custom-enter-from\n  enterActiveClass: custom-enter-active\n---\n"

For example:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n---\nlayout: center\nbackground: './images/background-1.png'\nclass: 'text-white'\n---​\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis is a page with the layout `center` and a background image.\n\n---\n\n# Page 3\n\nThis is a default page without any additional metadata.\n\n\nRefer to customization for more details.\n\nThe custom syntax might not be compactible with some formatters like Prettier. To improve that, we also support using a direct yaml code block to define the frontmatter:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n---\n\n```yaml\n# The first yaml block will be treated as the frontmatter of that slide\nlayout: center\nbackground: './images/background-1.png'\nclass: 'text-white'\n```\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis is a page with the layout `center` and a background image.\n\n\n(Available since v0.44.0)\n\nCode Blocks\n#\n\nOne big reason I am building Slidev is needing to make my code look just right in the slides. So just as you expected, you can use Markdown flavored code block to highlight your code.\n\n//```ts\nconsole.log('Hello, World!')\n//```\n\n\nWe support Prism and Shiki as syntax highlighters. Refer to the highlighters section for more details.\n\nLine Highlighting\n#\n\nTo highlight specific lines, simply add line numbers within bracket {}. Line numbers start counting from 1 by default.\n\n//```ts {2,3}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nYou can enable line number to all slides by setting lineNumbers: true on the config or enable each code block individually by setting lines:true. In case you want to disable the numbering for an specific block when lineNumbers: true you can set lines:false for that block:\n\n//```ts {2,3} {lines:true}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nYou can also set the starting line for each code block and highlight the lines accordingly, defaults to 1:\n\n//```ts {6,7} {lines:true, startLine:5}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nTo change the highlight in multiple steps, you can use | to separate them. For example\n\n//```ts {2-3|5|all}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nThis will first highlight a: Ref<number> | number and b: Ref<number> | number, and then return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b)) after one click, and lastly, the whole block. Learn more in the clicks animations guide.\n\nYou can start the highlight at a specific click:\n\n//```ts {2-3|5|all} {at:0}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nThis is especially useful when you need to sync different animations (when using two-cols layout and list animation for instance).\n\nTo skip highlighting any lines, you can set the line number to 0. For example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//```ts {0}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nIf the code doesn't fit into one slide, you can pass an extra maxHeight option which will set fixed height and enable scrolling\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//```ts {2|3|7|12} {maxHeight:'100px'}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n/// ...as many lines as you want\nconst c = add(1, 2)\n//```\n\nMonaco Editor\n#\n\nWhenever you want to do some modification in the presentation, simply add {monaco} after the language id — it turns the block into a fully-featured Monaco editor!\n\n//```ts {monaco}\nconsole.log('HelloWorld')\n//```\n\n\nLearn more about configuring Monaco.\n\nMonaco diff\n#\n\nMonaco can also generate a diff between two code blocks. Use {monaco-diff} to turn the block into a diff Monaco editor and use ~~~ to separate both original and modified version of the code!\n\n//```ts {monaco-diff}\nThis line is removed on the right.\njust some text\nabcd\nefgh\nSome more text\n~~~\njust some text\nabcz\nzzzzefgh\nSome more text.\nThis line is removed on the left.\n//```\n\nEmbedded Styles\n#\n\nYou can use <style> tag in your Markdown directly to override styles for the current slide.\n\n# This is Red\n\n<style>\nh1 {\n  color: red\n}\n</style>\n\n---\n\n# Next slide is not affected\n\n\n<style> tag in Markdown is always scoped. As an outstanding result, a selector with the child combinator (.a > .b) is unusable as such; see the previous link. To have global style overrides, check out the customization section.\n\nPowered by UnoCSS, you can directly use nested css and directives (e.g. @apply)\n\n# Slidev\n\n> Hello `world`\n\n<style>\nblockquote {\n  code {\n    @apply text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n\nStatic Assets\n#\n\nJust like you would do in markdown, you can use images pointing to a remote or local url.\n\nFor remote assets, the built-in vite-plugin-remote-assets will cache them into the disk at the first run so you can have instant loading even for large images later on.\n\n![Remote Image](https://sli.dev/favicon.png)\n\n\nFor local assets, put them into the public folder and reference them with leading slash.\n\n![Local Image](/pic.png)\n\n\nFor you want to apply custom sizes or styles, you can convert them to the <img> tag\n\n<img src=\"/pic.png\" class=\"m-40 h-40 rounded shadow\" />\n\nNotes\n#\n\nYou can also take notes for each slide. They will show up in Presenter Mode for you to reference during presentations.\n\nIn Markdown, the last comment block in each slide will be treated as a note.\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Page 1\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n<!-- This is a note -->\n\n---\n\n# Page 2\n\n<!-- This is NOT a note because it precedes the content of the slide -->\n\nThe second page\n\n<!--\nThis is another note\n-->\n\nIcons\n#\n\nSlidev allows you to have the accessing to almost all the popular open-source iconsets directly in your markdown. Powered by unplugin-icons and Iconify.\n\nThe naming follows Iconify's conversion {collection-name}-{icon-name}. For example:\n\n<mdi-account-circle /> -  from Material Design Icons\n<carbon-badge /> -  from Carbon\n<uim-rocket /> -  from Unicons Monochrome\n<twemoji-cat-with-tears-of-joy /> -  from Twemoji\n<logos-vue /> -  from SVG Logos\nAnd much more...\n\nBrowse and search for all the icons available with Icônes.\n\nStyling Icons\n#\n\nYou can style the icons just like other HTML elements. For example:\n\n<uim-rocket />\n<uim-rocket class=\"text-3xl text-red-400 mx-2\" />\n<uim-rocket class=\"text-3xl text-orange-400 animate-ping\" />\n\nSlots\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.18\n\nSome layouts can provide multiple contributing points using Vue's named slots.\n\nFor example, in two-cols layout, you can have two columns left (default slot) and right (right slot) side by side.\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n<template v-slot:default>\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\n</template>\n<template v-slot:right>\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n</template>\n\nLeft\n\nThis shows on the left\n\nRight\n\nThis shows on the right\n\nWe also provide a shorthand syntax sugar ::name:: for slot name. The following example works exactly the same as the previous one.\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\n::right::\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n\nYou can also explicitly specify the default slot and provide in the custom order\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n::right::\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n::default::\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\nConfigurations\n#\n\nAll configurations needed can be defined in the Markdown file. For example:\n\n---\ntheme: seriph\nlayout: cover\nbackground: 'https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?nature,water'\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n\nLearn more about frontmatter configurations.\n\nLaTeX\n#\n\nSlidev comes with LaTeX support out-of-box, powered by KaTeX.\n\nInline\n#\n\nSurround your LaTeX with a single $ on each side for inline rendering.\n\n$\\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$\n\nBlock\n#\n\nUse two ($$) for block rendering.

The syntax of the object is a JavaScript object literal, you will need to add quotes (') for strings and use comma (,) between keys.\n\n//```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 0.8}\ngraph TD\nB[Text] --> C{Decision}\nC -->|One| D[Result 1]\nC -->|Two| E[Result 2]\n//```\n\n\nLearn more: Demo | Mermaid\n\nMultiple Entries\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.15\n\nYou can split your slides.md into multiple files and organize them as you want.\n\nslides.md :\n\n# Page 1\n\nThis is a normal page\n\n---\nsrc: ./subpage2.md\n---\n\n<!-- this page will be loaded from './subpage2.md' -->\nInline content will be ignored\n\n\nsubpage2.md :\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis page is from another file\n\nFrontmatter Merging\n#\n\nYou can provide frontmatters from both your main entry and external markdown pages. If there are the same keys in them, the ones from the main entry have the higher priority. For example\n\nslides.md :\n\n---\nsrc: ./cover.md\nbackground: https://sli.dev/bar.png\nclass: text-center\n---\n\n\ncover.md :\n\n---\nlayout: cover\nbackground: https://sli.dev/foo.png\n---\n\n# Cover\n\nCover Page\n\n\nThey will end up being equivalent of the following page:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\nbackground: https://sli.dev/bar.png\nclass: text-center\n---\n\n# Cover\n\nCover Page\n\nPage Reusing\n#\n\nWith the multi-entries support, reusing pages could be straightforward. For example:\n\n---\nsrc: ./cover.md\n---\n\n---\nsrc: ./intro.md\n---\n\n---\nsrc: ./content.md\n---\n\n---\n# reuse\nsrc: ./content.md\n---\n\nMDC Syntax\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nSlidev has and experimental support for MDC (Markdown Components) Syntax powered by markdown-it-mdc.\n\nYou can enable it by add mdc: true to the frontmatter of your markdown file.\n\n---\nmdc: true\n---\n\nThis is a [red text]{style=\"color:red\"} :inline-component{prop=\"value\"}\n\n![](/image.png){width=500px lazy}\n\n::block-component{prop=\"value\"}\nThe **default** slot\n::\n\n\nLearn more about the syntax."

It will generate static HTML files under dist folder.\n\nHost on Github Pages\n#\n\nYou can host dist in a static web site such as Github Pages or Gitlab Pages.\n\nBecause in Github pages the url may contain subfolder, so you need to modify the generated index.html to change href=\"/assets/xxx to href=\"./assets/xxx. Or you may use --base=/<subfolder>/ option during the build process, such as: docker exec -i slidev npx slidev build --base=/slidev_docker/.\n\nAnd to avoid Jekyll build process, you need to add an empty file .nojekyll.\n\nHost by docker\n#\n\nYou can also host it by yourself with docker:\n\ndocker run --name myslides --rm -p 80:80 -v ${PWD}/dist:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine\n\n\nOr create a static image with following Dockerfile:\n\nFROM nginx:alpine\n\nCOPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html\n\n\nCreate the docker image: docker build -t mystaticppt .\n\nAnd run the container: docker run --name myslides --rm -p 80:80 mystaticppt\n\nYou can visit your slides from http://localhost/\n\nRefer to the tangramor/slidev_docker for more details.\n\nCommand Line Interface (CLI)\n#\n\n@slidev/cli Expose a few commands you can use with npx slidev ... or by adding scripts in your package.json:\n\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"dev\": \"slidev\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn that case you will be able to run npm run dev.\n\nYou can pass options to any commands:\n\nboolean option are true if they are present, false otherwise (example: slidev --open)\nsome options can have values you can add just after the option or by using the = character (example: slidev --port 8080 or slidev --port=8080)\n\nIf you use npm scripts, don't forget to add -- after the npm command:\n\nnpm run slidev -- --open\n\nslidev [entry]\n#\n\nStart a local server for Slidev.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--port, -p (number, default: 3030): port number.\n--open, -o (boolean, default: false): open in browser.\n--remote [password] (string): listen to public host and enable remote control, if a value is passed then the presenter mode is private and only accessible by passing the given password in the URL query password parameter.\n--log ('error', 'warn', 'info', 'silent', default: 'warn'): Log level.\n--force, -f (boolean, default false): force the optimizer to ignore the cache and re-bundle.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev build [entry]\n#\n\nBuild hostable SPA.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--watch, -w (boolean, default: false): build watch.\n--out, -o (string, default: dist): output dir.\n--base (string, default: /): base URL (see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#publicpath)\n--download (boolean, default: false): allow to download the slides as PDF inside the SPA.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev export [entry]\n#\n\nExport slides to PDF (or other format).\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--output (string, default: use exportFilename (see https://sli.dev/custom/#frontmatter-configures) or use [entry]-export): path to the output.\n--format ('pdf', 'png', 'md', default: 'pdf'): output format.\n--timeout (number, default: 30000): timeout for rendering the print page (see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto).\n--range (string): page ranges to export (example: '1,4-5,6').\n--dark (boolean, default: false): export as dark theme.\n--with-clicks, -c (boolean, default: false): export pages for every clicks (see https://sli.dev/guide/animations.html#click-animations).\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev format [entry]\n#\n\nFormat the markdown file.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\nslidev theme [subcommand]\n#\n\nTheme related operations.\n\nSubcommands:\n\neject [entry]: Eject current theme into local file system\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\nOptions:\n--dir (string, default: theme): output dir.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme."

CSS Grids, flexboxes, or even Masonry, you get the full controls.\n\nSince we have UnoCSS built-in, here is one simple way for you to reference:\n\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-4\">\n<div>\n\nThe first column\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe second column\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\nGo further, you can customize the size of each column like:\n\n<div class=\"grid grid-cols-[200px_1fr_10%] gap-4\">\n<div>\n\nThe first column (200px)\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe second column (auto fit)\n\n</div>\n<div>\n\nThe third column (10% width to parent container)\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\nLearn more about Windi CSS Grids.\n\nPositioning\n#\n\nSlides are defined in fixed sizes (default 980x552px) and scale to fit with the user screen. You can safely use absolute position in your slides as they will scale along with the screen.\n\nFor example:\n\n<div class=\"absolute left-30px bottom-30px\">\nThis is a left-bottom aligned footer\n</div>\n\n\nTo change the canvas' actual size, you can pass the canvasWidth options in your first frontmatter:\n\n---\ncanvasWidth: 800\n---\n\nFont Size\n#\n\nIf you feel the font size in your slides are too small, you can adjust it in a few ways:\n\nOverride Local Style\n#\n\nYou can override styles for each slide with the inlined <style> tag.\n\n# Page 1\n\n<style>\nh1 {\n  font-size: 10em;\n}\n</style>\n\n---\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis will not be affected.\n\n\nLearn more: Embedded Styles\n\nOverride Global Style\n#\n\nYou can provide custom global styles by creating ./style.css, for example\n\n/* style.css */ \n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 10em !important;\n}\n\n\nLearn more: Global Style\n\nScale the Canvas\n#\n\nChanging the canvas' actual size will scale all your contents(text, images, components, etc.) and slides\n\n---\n# default: 980\n# since the canvas gets smaller, the visual size will become larger\ncanvasWidth: 800\n---\n\nUse Transform\n#\n\nWe provide a built-in component <Transform />, which is a thin wrapper of CSS transform property.\n\n<Transform :scale=\"1.4\">\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n\n</Transform>\n"

It's a shorthand to apply the v-click directive to all its child elements. It is especially useful when working with lists.\n\n<v-clicks>\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n- Item 4\n\n</v-clicks>\n\n\nAn item will become visible each time you click \"next\".\n\nIt accepts a depth props for nested list:\n\n<v-clicks depth=\"2\">\n\n- Item 1\n  - Item 1.1\n  - Item 1.2\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2.1\n  - Item 2.2\n\n</v-clicks>\n\nCustom Clicks Count\n#\n\nBy default, Slidev counts how many steps are needed before going to the next slide. You can override this setting by passing the clicks frontmatter option:\n\n---\n# 10 clicks in this slide, before going to the next\nclicks: 10\n---\n\nOrdering\n#\n\nPassing the click index to your directives, you can customize the order of the revealing\n\n<div v-click>1</div>\n<div v-click>2</div>\n<div v-click>3</div>\n\n<!-- the order is reversed -->\n<div v-click=\"3\">1</div>\n<div v-click=\"2\">2</div>\n<div v-click=\"1\">3</div>\n\n---\nclicks: 3\n---\n\n<!-- visible after 3 clicks -->\n<v-clicks at=\"3\">\n  <div>Hi</div>\n</v-clicks>\n\nEnter & Leave\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nYou can also specify the enter and leave index for the v-click directive by passing an array. The end index is exclusive.\n\n<div v-click=\"[2, 4]\">This will be shown on the 2nd and 3rd clicks, and hide again after the 4th.</div>\n\nElement Transitions\n#\n\nWhen you apply the v-click directive to your elements, it will attach the class name slidev-vclick-target to it. When the elements are hidden, the class name slidev-vclick-hidden will also be attached. For example:\n\n<div class=\"slidev-vclick-target slidev-vclick-hidden\">Text</div>\n\n\nAfter a click, it will become\n\n<div class=\"slidev-vclick-target\">Text</div>\n\n\nBy default, a subtle opacity transition is applied to those classes:\n\n// the default\n\n.slidev-vclick-target {\n  transition: opacity 100ms ease;\n}\n\n.slidev-vclick-hidden {\n  opacity: 0;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n\nYou can override them to customize the transition effects in your custom stylesheets.\n\nFor example, you can achieve the scaling up transitions by:\n\n// styles.css\n\n.slidev-vclick-target {\n  transition: all 500ms ease;\n}\n\n.slidev-vclick-hidden {\n  transform: scale(0);\n}\n\n\nTo specify animations for only certain slide or layout\n\n.slidev-page-7,\n.slidev-layout.my-custom-layout {\n  .slidev-vclick-target {\n    transition: all 500ms ease;\n  }\n\n  .slidev-vclick-hidden {\n    transform: scale(0);\n  }\n}\n\n\nLearn more about customizing styles.\n\nMotion\n#\n\nSlidev has @vueuse/motion built-in. You can use the v-motion directive to any elements to make apply motion on them. For example\n\n<div\n  v-motion\n  :initial=\"{ x: -80 }\"\n  :enter=\"{ x: 0 }\">\n  Slidev\n</div>\n\n\nThe text Slidev will move from -80px to its original position on initialization.\n\nNote: Slidev preloads the next slide for performance, which means the animations might start before you navigate to the page. To get it works properly, you can disable the preloading for the particular slide\n\n---\npreload: false\n---\n\n\nOr control the element life-cycle with v-if to have fine-grained controls\n\n<div\n  v-if=\"$slidev.nav.currentPage === 7\"\n  v-motion\n  :initial=\"{ x: -80 }\"\n  :enter=\"{ x: 0 }\">\n  Slidev\n</div>\n\n\nLearn mode: Demo | @vueuse/motion | v-motion | Presets\n\nSlide Transitions\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.39.0\n\nSlidev supports slide transitions out of the box. You can enable it by setting the transition frontmatter option:\n\n---\ntransition: slide-left\n---\n\n\nThis will give you a nice sliding effects on slide switching. Setting it in the frontmatter will apply to all slides. You can also set different transition per slide.\n\nBuiltin Transitions\n#\nfade - Crossfade in/out\nfade-out - Fade out and then fade in\nslide-left - Slides to the left (slide to right when going backward)\nslide-right - Slides to the right (slide to left when going backward)\nslide-up - Slides to the top (slide to bottom when going backward)\nslide-down - Slides to the bottom (slide to top when going backward)\nview-transition - Slides with the view transitions API\nView Transitions\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nThe View Transitions API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different DOM states. Learn more how it works in View Transitions API - MDN Web Docs - Mozilla.\n\nExperimental: This is not supported by all browsers. Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this.\n\nYou can use the view-transition-name CSS property to name view transitions, which creates connections between different page elements and smooth transitions when switching slides.\n\nYou can enable MDC (Markdown Component) Syntax support to conveniently name view-transitions:\n\n---\ntransition: view-transition\nmdc: true\n---\n# View Transition {.inline-block.view-transition-title}\n---\n# View Transition {.inline-block.view-transition-title}\n\nCustom Transitions\n#\n\nSlidev's slide transitions are powered by Vue Transition. You can provide your custom transitions by:\n\n---\ntransition: my-transition\n---\n\n\nand then in your custom stylesheets:\n\n.my-transition-enter-active,\n.my-transition-leave-active {\n  transition: opacity 0.5s ease;\n}\n\n.my-transition-enter-from,\n.my-transition-leave-to {\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n\n\nLearn more how it works in Vue Transition.\n\nForward & Backward Transitions\n#\n\nYou can specify different transitions for forward and backward navigation using | as a separator in the transition name:\n\n---\ntransition: go-forward | go-backward\n---\n\n\nWith this, when you go from slide 1 to slide 2, the go-forward transition will be applied. When you go from slide 2 to slide 1, the go-backward transition will be applied.\n\nAdvanced Usage\n#\n\nThe transition field accepts an option that will passed to the <TransitionGroup> component. For example:\n\n---\ntransition:\n  name: my-transition\n  enterFromClass: custom-enter-from\n  enterActiveClass: custom-enter-active\n---\n"

    "html": "Why Slidev\n#\n\nThere are a lot of feature-rich, general-purpose, WYSIWYG slides makers like Microsoft PowerPoint and Apple Keynote. They work pretty well for making nice slides with animations, charts, and many other things, while being very intuitive and easy to learn. So why bother making Slidev?\n\nSlidev aims to provide the flexibility and interactivity for developers to make their presentations even more interesting, expressive, and attractive by using the tools and technologies they are already familiar with.\n\nWhen working with WYSIWYG editors, it is easy to get distracted by the styling options. Slidev remedies that by separating the content and visuals. This allows you to focus on one thing at a time, while also being able to reuse the themes from the community. Slidev does not seek to replace other slide deck builders entirely. Rather, it focuses on catering to the developer community.\n\nSlidev\n#\n\nHere are a few of the coolest features of Slidev:\n\nMarkdown-based\n#\n\nSlidev uses an extended Markdown format to store and organize your slides in a single plain text file. This lets you focus on making the content. And since the content and styles are separated, this also made it possible to switch between different themes effortlessly.\n\nLearn more about Slidev's Markdown Syntax.\n\nThemable\n#\n\nThemes for Slidev can be shared and installed using npm packages. You then apply them with only one line of config.\n\nCheck out the theme gallery or learn how to write a theme.\n\nDeveloper Friendly\n#\n\nSlidev provides first-class support for code snippets for developers. It supports both Prism and Shiki to get pixel perfect syntax highlighting, while still being able to modify the code at any time. With Monaco editor built-in, it also empowers you to do live coding / demonstration in your presentation with autocompletion, type hovering, and even TypeScript type check support.\n\nLearn more about highlighters and Monaco configuration.\n\nFast\n#\n\nSlidev is powered by Vite, Vue 3 and UnoCSS, which give you the most wonderful authoring experience. Every change you made will reflect to your slides instantly.\n\nFind more about our tech stack.\n\nInteractive & Expressive\n#\n\nYou can write custom Vue components and use them directly inside your markdown file. You can also interact with them inside the presentation to express your idea in a more interesting and intuitive way.\n\nRecording Support\n#\n\nSlidev provides built-in recording and camera view. You can share your presentation with your camera view inside, or record and save them separately for your screen and camera. All with one go, no additional tools are needed.\n\nLearn more about recording here.\n\nPortable\n#\n\nExport your slides into PDF, PNGs, or even a hostable Single-page Application (SPA) with a single command, and share them anywhere.\n\nRead more about that in the exporting docs.\n\nHackable\n#\n\nBeing powered by web technologies, anything that can be done in a web app is also possible with Slidev. For example, WebGL, API requests, iframes, or even live sharing. It's up to your imagination!\n\nGive it a Try\n#\n\nPlaying around with Slidev will tell you more than a thousand words. You are just one command away:\n\n$ npm init slidev\n\n\nOr have a quick preview of it:"

    "title": "Markdown Syntax | Slidev",
    "url": "https://sli.dev/guide/syntax.html",
    "html": "Markdown Syntax\n#\n\nSlides are written within a single markdown file (by default ./slides.md).\n\nYou can use the Markdown features as you normally would, with the additional support of inlined HTML and Vue Components. Styling using UnoCSS is also supported. Use --- padded with a new line to separate your slides.\n\n# Slidev\n\nHello, World!\n\n---\n\n# Page 2\n\nDirectly use code blocks for highlighting\n\n//```ts\nconsole.log('Hello, World!')\n//```\n\n---\n\n# Page 3\n\nYou can directly use Windi CSS and Vue components to style and enrich your slides.\n\n<div class=\"p-3\">\n  <Tweet id=\"20\" />\n</div>\n\nFront Matter & Layouts\n#\n\nSpecify layouts and other metadata for each slide by converting the separators into front matter blocks. Each frontmatter starts with a triple-dash and ends with another. Texts between them are data objects in YAML format. For example:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n---\nlayout: center\nbackground: './images/background-1.png'\nclass: 'text-white'\n---​\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis is a page with the layout `center` and a background image.\n\n---\n\n# Page 3\n\nThis is a default page without any additional metadata.\n\n\nRefer to customization for more details.\n\nThe custom syntax might not be compactible with some formatters like Prettier. To improve that, we also support using a direct yaml code block to define the frontmatter:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n---\n\n```yaml\n# The first yaml block will be treated as the frontmatter of that slide\nlayout: center\nbackground: './images/background-1.png'\nclass: 'text-white'\n```\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis is a page with the layout `center` and a background image.\n\n\n(Available since v0.44.0)\n\nCode Blocks\n#\n\nOne big reason I am building Slidev is needing to make my code look just right in the slides. So just as you expected, you can use Markdown flavored code block to highlight your code.\n\n//```ts\nconsole.log('Hello, World!')\n//```\n\n\nWe support Prism and Shiki as syntax highlighters. Refer to the highlighters section for more details.\n\nLine Highlighting\n#\n\nTo highlight specific lines, simply add line numbers within bracket {}. Line numbers start counting from 1 by default.\n\n//```ts {2,3}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nYou can enable line number to all slides by setting lineNumbers: true on the config or enable each code block individually by setting lines:true. In case you want to disable the numbering for an specific block when lineNumbers: true you can set lines:false for that block:\n\n//```ts {2,3} {lines:true}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nYou can also set the starting line for each code block and highlight the lines accordingly, defaults to 1:\n\n//```ts {6,7} {lines:true, startLine:5}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nTo change the highlight in multiple steps, you can use | to separate them. For example\n\n//```ts {2-3|5|all}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nThis will first highlight a: Ref<number> | number and b: Ref<number> | number, and then return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b)) after one click, and lastly, the whole block. Learn more in the clicks animations guide.\n\nYou can start the highlight at a specific click:\n\n//```ts {2-3|5|all} {at:0}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nThis is especially useful when you need to sync different animations (when using two-cols layout and list animation for instance).\n\nTo skip highlighting any lines, you can set the line number to 0. For example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//```ts {0}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n//```\n\n\nIf the code doesn't fit into one slide, you can pass an extra maxHeight option which will set fixed height and enable scrolling\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n//```ts {2|3|7|12} {maxHeight:'100px'}\nfunction add(\n  a: Ref<number> | number,\n  b: Ref<number> | number\n) {\n  return computed(() => unref(a) + unref(b))\n}\n/// ...as many lines as you want\nconst c = add(1, 2)\n//```\n\nMonaco Editor\n#\n\nWhenever you want to do some modification in the presentation, simply add {monaco} after the language id — it turns the block into a fully-featured Monaco editor!\n\n//```ts {monaco}\nconsole.log('HelloWorld')\n//```\n\n\nLearn more about configuring Monaco.\n\nMonaco diff\n#\n\nMonaco can also generate a diff between two code blocks. Use {monaco-diff} to turn the block into a diff Monaco editor and use ~~~ to separate both original and modified version of the code!\n\n//```ts {monaco-diff}\nThis line is removed on the right.\njust some text\nabcd\nefgh\nSome more text\n~~~\njust some text\nabcz\nzzzzefgh\nSome more text.\nThis line is removed on the left.\n//```\n\nEmbedded Styles\n#\n\nYou can use <style> tag in your Markdown directly to override styles for the current slide.\n\n# This is Red\n\n<style>\nh1 {\n  color: red\n}\n</style>\n\n---\n\n# Next slide is not affected\n\n\n<style> tag in Markdown is always scoped. As an outstanding result, a selector with the child combinator (.a > .b) is unusable as such; see the previous link. To have global style overrides, check out the customization section.\n\nPowered by UnoCSS, you can directly use nested css and directives (e.g. @apply)\n\n# Slidev\n\n> Hello `world`\n\n<style>\nblockquote {\n  code {\n    @apply text-teal-500 dark:text-teal-400;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n\nStatic Assets\n#\n\nJust like you would do in markdown, you can use images pointing to a remote or local url.\n\nFor remote assets, the built-in vite-plugin-remote-assets will cache them into the disk at the first run so you can have instant loading even for large images later on.\n\n![Remote Image](https://sli.dev/favicon.png)\n\n\nFor local assets, put them into the public folder and reference them with leading slash.\n\n![Local Image](/pic.png)\n\n\nFor you want to apply custom sizes or styles, you can convert them to the <img> tag\n\n<img src=\"/pic.png\" class=\"m-40 h-40 rounded shadow\" />\n\nNotes\n#\n\nYou can also take notes for each slide. They will show up in Presenter Mode for you to reference during presentations.\n\nIn Markdown, the last comment block in each slide will be treated as a note.\n\n---\nlayout: cover\n---\n\n# Page 1\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n<!-- This is a note -->\n\n---\n\n# Page 2\n\n<!-- This is NOT a note because it precedes the content of the slide -->\n\nThe second page\n\n<!--\nThis is another note\n-->\n\nIcons\n#\n\nSlidev allows you to have the accessing to almost all the popular open-source iconsets directly in your markdown. Powered by unplugin-icons and Iconify.\n\nThe naming follows Iconify's conversion {collection-name}-{icon-name}. For example:\n\n<mdi-account-circle /> -  from Material Design Icons\n<carbon-badge /> -  from Carbon\n<uim-rocket /> -  from Unicons Monochrome\n<twemoji-cat-with-tears-of-joy /> -  from Twemoji\n<logos-vue /> -  from SVG Logos\nAnd much more...\n\nBrowse and search for all the icons available with Icônes.\n\nStyling Icons\n#\n\nYou can style the icons just like other HTML elements. For example:\n\n<uim-rocket />\n<uim-rocket class=\"text-3xl text-red-400 mx-2\" />\n<uim-rocket class=\"text-3xl text-orange-400 animate-ping\" />\n\nSlots\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.18\n\nSome layouts can provide multiple contributing points using Vue's named slots.\n\nFor example, in two-cols layout, you can have two columns left (default slot) and right (right slot) side by side.\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n<template v-slot:default>\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\n</template>\n<template v-slot:right>\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n</template>\n\nLeft\n\nThis shows on the left\n\nRight\n\nThis shows on the right\n\nWe also provide a shorthand syntax sugar ::name:: for slot name. The following example works exactly the same as the previous one.\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\n::right::\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n\nYou can also explicitly specify the default slot and provide in the custom order\n\n---\nlayout: two-cols\n---\n\n::right::\n\n# Right\n\nThis shows on the right\n\n::default::\n\n# Left\n\nThis shows on the left\n\nConfigurations\n#\n\nAll configurations needed can be defined in the Markdown file. For example:\n\n---\ntheme: seriph\nlayout: cover\nbackground: 'https://source.unsplash.com/1600x900/?nature,water'\n---\n\n# Slidev\n\nThis is the cover page.\n\n\nLearn more about frontmatter configurations.\n\nLaTeX\n#\n\nSlidev comes with LaTeX support out-of-box, powered by KaTeX.\n\nInline\n#\n\nSurround your LaTeX with a single $ on each side for inline rendering.\n\n$\\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$\n\nBlock\n#\n\nUse two ($$) for block rendering. This mode uses bigger symbols and centers the result.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{\\mathbf{B}} -\\, \\frac1c\\, \\frac{\\partial\\vec{\\mathbf{E}}}{\\partial t} &\n= \\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\vec{\\mathbf{j}}    \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \\pi \\rho \\\\\n\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{\\mathbf{E}}\\, +\\, \\frac1c\\, \\frac{\\partial\\vec{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} & = \\vec{\\mathbf{0}} \\\\\n\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{B}} & = 0\n\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n\nLearn more: Demo | KaTeX | markdown-it-katex\n\nLaTex line highlighting\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.1\n\nTo highlight specific lines, simply add line numbers within bracket {}. Line numbers start counting from 1 by default.\n\n$$ {1|3|all}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{\\mathbf{B}} -\\, \\frac1c\\, \\frac{\\partial\\vec{\\mathbf{E}}}{\\partial t} &\n= \\frac{4\\pi}{c}\\vec{\\mathbf{j}}    \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \\pi \\rho \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{\\mathbf{E}}\\, +\\, \\frac1c\\, \\frac{\\partial\\vec{\\mathbf{B}}}{\\partial t} & = \\vec{\\mathbf{0}} \\\\\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{\\mathbf{B}} & = 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nDiagrams\n#\n\nYou can also create diagrams / graphs from textual descriptions in your Markdown, powered by Mermaid.\n\nCode blocks marked as mermaid will be converted to diagrams, for example:\n\n//```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?\n  Note over Alice,John: A typical interaction\n//```\n\n\nYou can further pass an options object to it to specify the scaling and theming. The syntax of the object is a JavaScript object literal, you will need to add quotes (') for strings and use comma (,) between keys.\n\n//```mermaid {theme: 'neutral', scale: 0.8}\ngraph TD\nB[Text] --> C{Decision}\nC -->|One| D[Result 1]\nC -->|Two| E[Result 2]\n//```\n\n\nLearn more: Demo | Mermaid\n\nMultiple Entries\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.15\n\nYou can split your slides.md into multiple files and organize them as you want.\n\nslides.md :\n\n# Page 1\n\nThis is a normal page\n\n---\nsrc: ./subpage2.md\n---\n\n<!-- this page will be loaded from './subpage2.md' -->\nInline content will be ignored\n\n\nsubpage2.md :\n\n# Page 2\n\nThis page is from another file\n\nFrontmatter Merging\n#\n\nYou can provide frontmatters from both your main entry and external markdown pages. If there are the same keys in them, the ones from the main entry have the higher priority. For example\n\nslides.md :\n\n---\nsrc: ./cover.md\nbackground: https://sli.dev/bar.png\nclass: text-center\n---\n\n\ncover.md :\n\n---\nlayout: cover\nbackground: https://sli.dev/foo.png\n---\n\n# Cover\n\nCover Page\n\n\nThey will end up being equivalent of the following page:\n\n---\nlayout: cover\nbackground: https://sli.dev/bar.png\nclass: text-center\n---\n\n# Cover\n\nCover Page\n\nPage Reusing\n#\n\nWith the multi-entries support, reusing pages could be straightforward. For example:\n\n---\nsrc: ./cover.md\n---\n\n---\nsrc: ./intro.md\n---\n\n---\nsrc: ./content.md\n---\n\n---\n# reuse\nsrc: ./content.md\n---\n\nMDC Syntax\n#\n\nAvailable since v0.43.0\n\nSlidev has and experimental support for MDC (Markdown Components) Syntax powered by markdown-it-mdc.\n\nYou can enable it by add mdc: true to the frontmatter of your markdown file.\n\n---\nmdc: true\n---\n\nThis is a [red text]{style=\"color:red\"} :inline-component{prop=\"value\"}\n\n![](/image.png){width=500px lazy}\n\n::block-component{prop=\"value\"}\nThe **default** slot\n::\n\n\nLearn more about the syntax."

It will generate static HTML files under dist folder.\n\nHost on Github Pages\n#\n\nYou can host dist in a static web site such as Github Pages or Gitlab Pages.\n\nBecause in Github pages the url may contain subfolder, so you need to modify the generated index.html to change href=\"/assets/xxx to href=\"./assets/xxx. Or you may use --base=/<subfolder>/ option during the build process, such as: docker exec -i slidev npx slidev build --base=/slidev_docker/.\n\nAnd to avoid Jekyll build process, you need to add an empty file .nojekyll.\n\nHost by docker\n#\n\nYou can also host it by yourself with docker:\n\ndocker run --name myslides --rm -p 80:80 -v ${PWD}/dist:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx:alpine\n\n\nOr create a static image with following Dockerfile:\n\nFROM nginx:alpine\n\nCOPY dist /usr/share/nginx/html\n\n\nCreate the docker image: docker build -t mystaticppt .\n\nAnd run the container: docker run --name myslides --rm -p 80:80 mystaticppt\n\nYou can visit your slides from http://localhost/\n\nRefer to the tangramor/slidev_docker for more details.\n\nCommand Line Interface (CLI)\n#\n\n@slidev/cli Expose a few commands you can use with npx slidev ... or by adding scripts in your package.json:\n\n{\n  \"script\": {\n    \"dev\": \"slidev\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn that case you will be able to run npm run dev.\n\nYou can pass options to any commands:\n\nboolean option are true if they are present, false otherwise (example: slidev --open)\nsome options can have values you can add just after the option or by using the = character (example: slidev --port 8080 or slidev --port=8080)\n\nIf you use npm scripts, don't forget to add -- after the npm command:\n\nnpm run slidev -- --open\n\nslidev [entry]\n#\n\nStart a local server for Slidev.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--port, -p (number, default: 3030): port number.\n--open, -o (boolean, default: false): open in browser.\n--remote [password] (string): listen to public host and enable remote control, if a value is passed then the presenter mode is private and only accessible by passing the given password in the URL query password parameter.\n--log ('error', 'warn', 'info', 'silent', default: 'warn'): Log level.\n--force, -f (boolean, default false): force the optimizer to ignore the cache and re-bundle.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev build [entry]\n#\n\nBuild hostable SPA.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--watch, -w (boolean, default: false): build watch.\n--out, -o (string, default: dist): output dir.\n--base (string, default: /): base URL (see https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#publicpath)\n--download (boolean, default: false): allow to download the slides as PDF inside the SPA.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev export [entry]\n#\n\nExport slides to PDF (or other format).\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\n\nOptions:\n\n--output (string, default: use exportFilename (see https://sli.dev/custom/#frontmatter-configures) or use [entry]-export): path to the output.\n--format ('pdf', 'png', 'md', default: 'pdf'): output format.\n--timeout (number, default: 30000): timeout for rendering the print page (see https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-goto).\n--range (string): page ranges to export (example: '1,4-5,6').\n--dark (boolean, default: false): export as dark theme.\n--with-clicks, -c (boolean, default: false): export pages for every clicks (see https://sli.dev/guide/animations.html#click-animations).\n--theme, -t (string): override theme.\nslidev format [entry]\n#\n\nFormat the markdown file.\n\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\nslidev theme [subcommand]\n#\n\nTheme related operations.\n\nSubcommands:\n\neject [entry]: Eject current theme into local file system\n[entry] (string, default: slides.md): path to the slides markdown entry.\nOptions:\n--dir (string, default: theme): output dir.\n--theme, -t (string): override theme."
